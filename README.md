# Hybrid Deep Learning Based System for Real-Time Misinformation and Crime Detection

## Project Overview
This project is a **hybrid machine learning and deep learning system** designed to detect **misinformation and crime-related content** from text data.  
The system analyzes given text and classifies it to help identify misleading information or crime-related messages in real time.

This project is developed mainly for **learning and academic purposes** to understand how AI models can be applied to text classification problems.

## Objectives
- Detect misinformation from text data  
- Identify crime-related content automatically  
- Apply hybrid deep learning techniques for better classification  
- Understand real-time text analysis workflow  

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Deep Learning  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  

---

## Methodology / Workflow
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather text data related to misinformation and crime  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Text cleaning  
   - Tokenization  
   - Removing stop words  

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Convert text into numerical format  

4. **Model Development**  
   - Build a hybrid deep learning model  

5. **Training & Testing**  
   - Train the model on prepared data  
   - Test model performance  

6. **Prediction**  
   - Classify input text in real time  

---

## Output / Results
- Classifies text into categories such as:
  - Misinformation  
  - Crime-related content  
  - Legitimate information  
- Displays prediction results based on trained model
